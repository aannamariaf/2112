blackjack/counting cards

This is an online blackjack game/counting cards practice simulator. The goal of the application is to teach users how to count cards, and to allow the user to test their new skills in an online casino version of blackjack. Counting cards is a method of keeping a count, based on the cards that have been seen, that allows blackjack players to have a better understanding of whether there are high or low cards left in a deck. This can allow them to make an educated bet before each round. An extra version of the game is also included that involves the use of double the hands which is meant to present a challenge to the user when they are practicing counting. 


The python file “Term Project TP3” should be run in an editor. All image files (card images, table image, and suit images) and text files (user data, “how to” instructions) submitted with the python file should be located in the same folder while the project is run. The cmu graphics file should also be included.
