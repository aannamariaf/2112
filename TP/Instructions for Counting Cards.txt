Card values:
10, J, Q, K, and A are all worth -1.
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are all worth +1.


How to count:
Start at 0 and add or subtract according to the card presented.


How the simulator works:
You will be asked for your current count after a certain number of cards have passed.

You will be presented with a True Count which is your current count divided by the number of decks
you are using and a betting recommendation (if you were to play with this count in a game).

Your True Count is how you determine how much to bet on a blackjack round. (You will practice this in blackjack)

You can use either formula: Amount to Bet = (True Count + 1) x 10 or  Amount to Bet = (True Count – 1) x 25 
depending on how high of a risk you want to take.

The basic principle is bet high for high counts and bet low for low counts.
 
If the count is negative or 0, bet the minimum.
